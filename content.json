the Yantze River which was designed by China and constructed with China-made materials. 上层的4车道公路桥长4589米，下层的双轨道铁路桥长6772米。铁路桥连接原来的天津——浦口·和上海——南京两条铁路线，使火车过江从过去一个半小时缩短为现在的2分钟。The upper deck is a 4,589 metre-long four-lane road bridge, and the lower deck a 6,772 metre-long double-rail one which joins the original Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing railway lines, shorten-ing the traveling time across the river from 1.5 hours to 2 minutes. 大桥是南北交通的重要枢纽，也是南京的著名景点之一。The bridge is not only a significant north-south traffic hub but also a famous scenic spot in Nanjing. 南京长江大桥的建成标志着中国桥梁建设的一个飞跃，大大方便了长江两岸的物资交流和人员往来，对促进经济发展和改善人民生活起到了巨大作用。The bridge marks a huge progress in China’s bridge construc-tion,greatly facilitating the exchanges of both goods and people on both sides of the Yangtze River and playing a major role in the development of economy and the improve-ment of people’s living condition. 翻译2 卢沟桥位于天安门广场西南15公里处，横跨永定河，是北京现存最古老的多拱石桥。Built in 1192 and rebuilt in 1698, the Lugou Bridge, which is located 15 kilometres south west of the Tian’anmen Square across the Yongding River,is the most ancient bridge with multiple arches in Beijing.卢沟桥最初建成于1192年，1698年重建，由281根柱子支撑。每根柱子上都有一头石狮。The bridge is sus-tained by 281 pillars, each of which has a stone lion on the end and more stone lions hiding on its head, back, abdomen or claws.这些石狮的头、背、腹部或爪子上都藏有着更多的狮子。这些石狮生动逼真、千姿百态，是卢沟桥石刻艺术的精品。These stone lions are so lifelike with various pos-tures that they are well accepted as fine works of art in stone carving.桥上的石狮不计其数，因而北京地区流传着”卢沟桥上的狮子——数不清”的说法。As there are too many stone lions on the bridge,a saying in Beijing goes,”The lions on the Lugou Bridge are beyond people’s count.”卢沟桥不仅以其美学特征闻名于世，还被公认为石桥建筑史上的一座丰碑。 The bridge is not only well-known for its aesthetic features but also well recog-nized as a monument in the architectural history of stone bridges. 翻译3 赵州桥建于隋朝，公元605年左右，长50.82米，宽9.6米，跨度37.37米。The Zhaozhou Bridge, which was built in the Sui Dynasty around 605 AD, is 50.82 metres long and 9.6 metres wide with a span of 37.37 metres.天才建筑师李春设计并监督了桥的建设。Li Chun,a genius architect, designed and supervised its construction.赵州桥结构新颖、造型优美。桥有一个大拱，在大拱的两端有两个小拱，帮助排泄洪水、减轻桥梁重量并节省石材。The bridge boasts a novel structure and a graceful appearance, with a major arch in the middle and two minor ones on its ends which help discharge floods, reduce the weight of the bridge and save stones.建成以来，该桥经受了多次洪水和地震，但其主体结构仍然完好无损，至今仍在使用。Since the completion, the bridge has withstood floods and earthquakes, but remains intact in its main struc-ture and stil available in use.赵州桥是世界桥梁建筑史上的一次创举，是中国古代文明史上的一项杰出成就。类似设计的桥梁直到14世纪才在欧洲出现，比赵州桥晚了700多年。 The Zhaozhou Bridge is a pio-neering undertaking in the world history of bridge construc-tion and a masterpiece of the Chinese ancient civilization for the simple reason that its similar bridge did not appear in Europe until the 14th century,700 years later than the Zhaozhou Bridge.","link":"/posts/20230309en_translate.html"},{"title":"英语六级翻译真题2","text":"翻译1 延安位于陕西省北部，地处黄河中游，是中国革命的圣地。Located in the northern part of
